"""Tanker Run: capacitated vehicle routing.

Depot 0 and villages 1..n on a 0..1000 grid. Villages are first dealt into m
balanced groups; only then are the capacity Q and the fleet size K fixed, so
those groups are always a feasible plan. K leaves 20% slack over m. Each suite
entry names the draw (profile["attempt"]) to use; the organizer's
private/find_attempts.py picks attempts where the starter fits within K. This
file does exactly one draw. Integer-only and deterministic.
